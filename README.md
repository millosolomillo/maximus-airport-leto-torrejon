## IMPORTANT: for users who have Navigraph Installed, read below!

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Uninstall Navigraph Navdata**
   - Open the **Navigraph Hub**.
   - Go to the **MSFS Navdata** section.
   - Click **"Remove"** to uninstall the navdata.

2. **Launch MSFS Once**
   - This clears any cached navdata and allows MSFS to rebuild its internal database without Navigraph interference.

3. **Close MSFS**

4. **Install Your Custom Scenery**
   - Place the scenery into your MSFS `Community` folder.

5. **Launch MSFS Again**
   - This allows MSFS to index and register your new scenery.

6. **Close MSFS**

7. **Reinstall Navigraph Navdata**
   - Open the **Navigraph Hub** again.
   - Reinstall the MSFS navdata.
   - The latest version of the Hub will detect your scenery and prioritize it correctly.
