# Torrejón LETO scenery for MSFS 2020

WIP for LETO. Let's make it properly :)

## IMPORTANT: for users who have Navigraph Installed, read below!

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Uninstall Navigraph Navdata**  
   Open the Navigraph Hub, go to the MSFS Navdata section, and click **Remove**.

2. **Launch MSFS Once**  
   This clears cached navdata and lets MSFS rebuild its internal database without Navigraph.

3. **Close MSFS**

4. **Install Your Custom Scenery**  
   Place the scenery into your MSFS `Community` folder.

5. **Launch MSFS Again**  
   This allows MSFS to index and register your new scenery.

6. **Close MSFS**

7. **Reinstall Navigraph Navdata**  
   Open the Navigraph Hub again and reinstall the MSFS navdata.  
   The latest version of the Hub will detect your scenery and prioritize it correctly.

## Work-in-Progress Notes

This scenery is still under development. Current particularities:

- Made in MSFS 2020. It works in MSFS 2024, but there are too many trees there; an exclusion polygon will be added.
- No 3D buildings planned in the first phase.
- No navaids planned; no overrides, leaving Navigraph to handle all navdata.
- Runway inclination profile follows the AIP.
- Ground textures are still in progress.
- Taxiway lighting is not yet implemented.
- Parking stands are mostly complete, with a few fighter lanes still pending.
- The northern area of the airfield still needs work.
